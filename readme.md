# blade - Code Generation Tool based on Handlebars.Net

blade - This project is a console utility developed in .NET Core 2.0 with Visual Studio Code on macOS.  Being my first .NET Core 2.0 project I am sure I will hit a wall or two.  The goal of the project is to use SQLClient and Handlebars.Net libraries to construct generated code (initially C#) for data access.

## Development Tools

For development you will need Visual Studio Code and .NET Core 2.0.
